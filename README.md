## 🧭 Who I Am

Founder of **@dercrafter-Networks** and co-founder of **@LamaLinuxCraftServer**,
I design and code smart and modern software — from Minecraft ecosystems (Java) to embedded systems (CPP with MbedOS6).  
My passion lies in Minecraft and Magic, and I'm always looking for new projects to build.

💚 Proud Slytherin.  
🧱 Active wizard on [#LBAH](https://dagilp.net/mods), the official Minecraft server of the German YouTuber [DaGiLP](https://www.youtube.com/@dagilp).  
📍 Based near Stuttgart, Southwest Germany — where tradition meets innovation.
